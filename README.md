![Santa PCB](https://github.com/EnginSUNAL/ChristmasPCB-2024/blob/7627d50f4f276fb5e2f8b65e4a08f6189c02c70c/Images/Final%20Product.jpg)

## 🎁 Project Overview

This festive PCB design was created as a **New Year’s gift** for fellow makers, , your love ones, engineers, and electronics enthusiasts.  
It’s more than just a holiday ornament — it’s a creative way to spread cheer through hardware design!

- 🎄 **Shape**: Santa Claus head silhouette  
- ✨ **Message**: “2024 – May this be your best year.” (silkscreened)  
- 🔋 **Function**: Can be powered via coin cell(CR 2032) – ideal for simple LED blink or greeting circuits  
- 🧠 **Design Tool**: Altium Designer

## 🚀 Getting Started

To replicate, modify, or explore the project:

1. **Clone** or **download** this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the design in **Altium Designer**.
3. Follow instructions or explore layout directly to see how it's built.
4. **Customize** anything you want – LEDs, silkscreen, dimensions, etc.
5. Export **Gerber files** and prepare for fabrication.
6. **Solder the components** onto the manufactured PCB as per the schematic.
7. Upload the provided **Arduino code** to bring your festive PCB to life.

## 📂 Contents

- 📁 **Project Files**: Includes Altium files (`.PrjPcb`, `.SchDoc`, `.PcbDoc`).
- 💡 **Embedded Software**: Arduino code file (`christmas2024.ino`) to drive LEDs or animations.
- 🖼️ **PCB Images**: From schematic to final PCB visuals exported from Altium.
- 📦 **BOM (Bill of Materials)**: Full list of components needed for assembly.

## 🤝 Contributing

Feel free to submit **pull requests** or open an **issue** if you have ideas, questions, or improvements to suggest.  
Let’s make hardware a little more festive together!

🔧 **Note**: Please mount the **CR2032 holder rotated 180°**.  
I missed this small detail — flipping it makes battery insertion easier after soldering.  
✅ This issue has already been fixed in the **2025 version**.
